# Plague Star and You: A Definitive Guide

### HOW TO START:
You can start the Plague Star bounty by selecting it from Konzu in Cetus.

---

### MISSION STEPS:
**Step 1**: You must retrieve Vay Hek's Toxin from a (marked) Grineer cave.

**Step 2**: You must insert Vay Hek's Toxin into the Toxin Mixer, and defend it for the duration of the mixing process.  
> NOTE: This is where items (Infested Catalyst & Eidolon Phylaxis) will be added if you have them. (Explained later)

**Step 3**: You must insert the newly mixed toxin into a downed drone, and escort it to the Infested Boil (final stage)

**Step 4**: You must eliminate Infested around the Boil. At each quarter % (25, 50, 75, 99) a Hemocyte will spawn depending on how many Infested Catalyst you mixed in Step 2. 
> **NOTE**: *Only ONE Hemocyte will spawn at a time, and the counter will stop until the Hemocyte is killed.  
> Each Eidolon Phylaxis you mixed in Step 2 will increase the difficulty of the Hemocytes you will encounter in this step.*

### INFESTED CATALYST? PHYLA-WHAT? WHERE DO I GET AND USE THESE ITEMS?:
+ The Infested Catalyst must be researched in the Infested Lab of your clan's dojo. The blueprint is reusable.

+ The Eidolon Phylaxis blueprint is purchasable from Nakak on Cetus after gaining 1000 operational standing from completing Plague Star missions. This blueprint is also reusable.

+ The Infested Catalyst increases the number of Hemocytes that will spawn in Step 4.

+ The Eidolon Phylaxis increases the difficulty of each Hemocyte that spawns in Step 4.

+ Once you build these two items using their respective blueprints, you MUST equip them in your Gear Wheel, found in the Arsenal.

+ To USE these items in Step 2, you must first insert the Toxin Injector. Then you must open the Gear Wheel, and click on the item. It will be consumed and will add to the HUD counter on the left of the screen.

### I'VE FINISHED A PLAGUE STAR BOUNTY! NOW WHAT?
+ Regardless of what you mixed in the Toxin Mixer, you will find that you have acquired some shiny 'Operational Standing'! Rolls right off the tongue.
+ You can spend your 'Operational Standing' at Nakak on Cetus by selecting 'Operational Supply' -> 'Offerings' from her menu.
+ It is advised that you max your Operational Supply rank before spending Operational Standing on purchaseable items. This way, you will have access to the best items sooner!

### TIPS
+ The Hemocyte is most weak to Corrosive and Blast damage.
+ Warframes that can slow/pause enemy movement (Eg. Nova, Rhino) are capable of extending the Hemocyte's vulnerable states.
+ A healing Warframe is recommended due to the gas clouds frequently encountered while fighting the Hemocyte.
+ Standing on the Boil or the rocks surrounding it will inflict a deadly Toxin status on the player. This can be useful when using Harrow or Chroma.
